    "# Part 2: Baseline RAG Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline was implemented to build a study assistant for Operating Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system retrieves relevant information from course materials and provides context-based answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Text Extraction\n",
    "PDF documents were processed using **pdfplumber** to extract text from each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "All extracted text was combined into a single corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Text Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted text was divided into smaller chunks using **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters used:\n",
    "- Chunk Size: 500 characters\n",
    "- Overlap: 100 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures context continuity across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Embedding Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text chunks were converted into numerical vector representations using:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:** SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model captures semantic meaning of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings were stored in a **FAISS vector database**, enabling efficient similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Retrieval System\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user asks a question:\n",
    "1. The question is converted into an embedding.\n",
    "2. FAISS retrieves the most similar text chunks.\n",
    "3. These chunks are returned as relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Questions Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is virtual memory?\n",
    "2. What is deadlock in operating systems?\n",
    "3. Difference between process and thread\n",
    "4. Explain CPU scheduling\n",
    "5. What is paging?\n",
    "6. What are semaphores?\n",
    "7. What is mutual exclusion?\n",
    "8. Explain process states\n",
    "9. What is segmentation?\n",
    "10. What is context switching?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualitative Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Worked Well\n",
    "- Factual questions were answered accurately.\n",
    "- Definitions and concept explanations were retrieved effectively.\n",
    "- Short concept-based queries gave good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Did Not Work Well\n",
    "- Questions requiring diagrams were not fully answered.\n",
    "- Some retrieved chunks lacked complete context.\n",
    "- Tables and formatted data were difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline RAG system performs well for conceptual and theoretical questions but struggles with structured content such as tables and diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements can be achieved through better chunking strategies and prompt engineering."

    "Sentence-based chunking performed better for Operating Systems study materials because:\n",

    "• OS concepts are typically explained in complete sentences.  \n",
    "• Preserving sentence boundaries maintained full context.  \n",
    "• Retrieval quality improved significantly.  \n",
    "• Generated answers were more coherent and informative.  \n",

    "Therefore, **sentence-based chunking is the preferred strategy** for this RAG system.\n",

    "## Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting multiple experiments, the final RAG system configuration was selected based on overall performance, accuracy, and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data processing, PDFs were extracted using **pdfplumber**, and text was collected page-wise. Different chunking strategies were tested, and sentence-based chunking performed better because it preserved context and improved answer quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For semantic understanding, the **SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** was used since it is lightweight, fast, and provides good embedding quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector database used was **ChromaDB**, which enabled efficient storage and fast semantic retrieval of document chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval strategy used **Top-K = 3**, as it provided the best balance between context coverage and noise reduction. Higher values introduced irrelevant information, while lower values reduced answer completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For answer generation, the **FLAN-T5-Base model** was selected because it runs locally, requires less memory, and generates accurate responses when provided with proper context.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **structured prompt strategy** was applied to ensure the model strictly used retrieved context and avoided hallucination, which significantly improved answer clarity and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the experimental evaluation showed that the best performance was achieved using the combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentence-based chunking\n",
    "* Structured prompt engineering\n",
    "* Top-K retrieval with K = 3\n",
    "* Lightweight embedding and language models\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that in a RAG system, careful optimization of preprocessing, chunking, retrieval, and prompting has a greater impact on performance than simply using larger models.\n"
